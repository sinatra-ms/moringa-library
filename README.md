## Collaboration Methodology

In order to contribute to this repository, you need to follow these steps:


* Create a new branch with your name and the feature you are working on. Example: `janedoe/reset-password`
```git
git branch name/feature
```

* Checkout to your branch in order to work on a feature.
```git
git checkout name/feature
```

* Once you have completed your work on the feature, create a commit with a comprehensive message. Example:
```git
git commit -m"Login: added JWT token in header"
```

* Push the changes to the remote repository
```git
git push -u origin name/feature
```

**Ensure you add any necessary variables in the appropriate file**. Example:
```
MONGO_DB_URI='random env here'
## DO NOT commit your .env files to version control
```

* Once your code is in the remote branch, create a pull request to the `main` branch.
* Each pull request will require at least 1 peer code review approval for the merge to be completed.
